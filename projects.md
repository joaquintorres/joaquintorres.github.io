# Projects
## Finished Projects
* [dturingmch](https://github.com/joaquintorres/dturingmch), a quick and dirty Turing Machine class in Python. *Warning: May not actually be a Turing Machine.*
* [autosubsync-mpv](https://github.com/joaquintorres/autosubsync-mpv), a script for automatic subtitle synchronization in mpv media player, using [ffsubsync](https://github.com/smacke/ffsubsync). 
## Future Projects and Ideas
* Upload and explain the char-RNN I trained with random quotes.
* Maybe add [multilingual support for this site](https://www.sylvaindurand.org/making-jekyll-multilingual/).
* Make a set of functions for [modifying Pokemon Red savefiles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVbRe7wr3G4).
* Characterization of lenses at home.
* Implement some diffraction algorithms. Maybe start from  [Rayleigh-Sommerfeld integration](https://www.osapublishing.org/ao/abstract.cfm?uri=ao-45-6-1102) and see some other papers used by [diffractio](https://pypi.org/project/diffractio/).
* Some optical ray tracing that accounts for aberrations?
* Implement Cooley-Tukey FFT in Python and/or C and see how it fares against a real implementation.
* Tinker with WebGL and graphics.
* Some basic Physics simulations in ECMA/Typescript?
* Finish reading [Bayesian Methods for Hackers](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers) and see if some interesting analysis can be done for COVID-19 cases.
* Continue with low level programming. Maybe a small bootloader? Need to know more.
