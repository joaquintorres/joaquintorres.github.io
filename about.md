<p>Like the frontpage says: I'm a human being, and I enjoy stuff. Also, I'm currently a Physics MSc. student, with a recent spark of interest in applied optics and photonics; and a knack for CS/programming, electronics, and a broader interest in scientific and technical topics. I also really enjoy movies, literature, philosophy, music, and I should probably stop there before this becomes a complete clich√©. </p>

<p>The objective of this blog is to be a place where I can put my technical projects (programming, electronics, physics,etc.), keep track of them, and write whatever comes to mind for such topics. And, since almost all technical knowledge is shared in English, I decided for now to do the same, although I might change that in the future. I hope that it may be of some interest to someone, but for now it'll work more as a personal expression thingy instead of something more serious.</p>
